# phd-code
Some code I've used throughout my PhD for data processing/fitting, etc. These scripts are currently only here as examples of my work. I may get round to uploading examples of the data files too so they can be used. The folder curve-fitting contains the julia scripts I used for data fitting in my tendon failure article, which can be found on my site www.james-gregory.co.uk. The FEM folder contains code related to finite element modelling of tendons (+ data processing).
