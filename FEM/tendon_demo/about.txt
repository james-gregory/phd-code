These scripts are to be used with oomph-lib which can be found at http://oomph-lib.maths.man.ac.uk/doc/html/index.html.

This code demonstrates how I model tendons in oomph-lib using a very simple example of a transversely isotropic hyperelastic cylinder. 

tendon_demo.cc contains the main function and sets up the problem.

MyDerivedClasses.h contains additional functionality that needs to be added for this specific problem e.g. a new get_stress function for our anisotropic material. We also overwrite the element's output functions here to produce the desired quantities.

parameters.h contains all parameters associated with the problem. These values can be changed using command line arguments which I input using a shell script.

tendon_demo.sh is a shell script which loops over the desired parameter values, compiles and runs the code, and creates new folders for the output. 

Makefile.am contains the libraries that must be linked in order for our code to run. These are not the standard oomph-lib libraries for this problem, some additional work must be done in order to make the get_stress function accept an eulerian position as an argument.
